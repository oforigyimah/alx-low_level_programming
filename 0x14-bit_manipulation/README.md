## Bit manipulation

This is the header file `main.h` for a C program that contains functions to perform bitwise operations on integers.

### Functions

- `binary_to_unit`: converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.
- `print_binary`: prints the binary representation of an unsigned long integer.
- `get_bit`: gets the value of the bit at the specified index in an unsigned long integer.
- `set_bit`: sets the bit at the specified index in an unsigned long integer to 1.
- `clear_bit`: clears the bit at the specified index in an unsigned long integer to 0.
- `flip_bits`: flips the bits of one unsigned long integer with another unsigned long integer.
- `get_endianness`: gets the endianness of the system.

### Usage

To use these functions, include the `main.h` header file in your C program and link the object file generated by compiling the `main.c` source file.
